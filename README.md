# Thermostat
Arduino thermostat using touchscreen LCD

This project was made for upgrade an old thermostat and control all the possible parameters connecting with a simple natural gas boiler.

The thermostat achieves simple automation with a graphic temperature display.

This was a personal work, and I added custom features that I wanted for me, like a theme editor and a date reminder (like new year or birthdays in my family, so the thermostat can congratulate you :P)

I made a case for print with a 3D printer but I need to test for myself first. Anyway you can try to connect the thermost where you want.
